# Keyboard Shortcuts Reference

Comunicado is designed for keyboard-driven efficiency. This guide covers all available shortcuts, organized by context and functionality.

> **Status Update**: This documentation has been updated to reflect only the keyboard shortcuts that are actually implemented and working. See `keyboard-shortcuts-working.md` for a verified list of all working shortcuts.

## Philosophy

Comunicado's keyboard shortcuts follow these principles:
- **Terminal compatibility first**: No function keys (F1-F12) to ensure universal compatibility
- Familiar patterns from popular terminal applications
- Vim-style navigation where appropriate
- Consistent modifiers across similar actions
- Context-aware design to prevent conflicts
- Discoverable through help screens and status bars

## Key Changes Made During Recent Updates

### Terminal Compatibility Migration (July 2025)

**BREAKING CHANGE**: All function keys (F1-F12) have been replaced with terminal-friendly alternatives for universal compatibility across all terminal environments, including VSCode terminal and remote SSH sessions.

#### F-Key Migration Summary:
- **F3 (Calendar)** → **`Ctrl+L`** (go to calendar)
- **F1 (Help)** → **`?`** (help/shortcuts)
- **F4 (Settings)** → **`,`** (comma, vim-style)
- **F5 (Refresh)** → **`Alt+R`** (refresh folder)
- **F2 (Rename)** → **`Alt+N`** (rename folder)
- **F1 (Save)** → **`Ctrl+S`** (save in forms)
- **F3 (Delete)** → **`d`** (delete in forms)

#### Compose Mode Migration:
- **F1 (Send)** → **`Ctrl+S`** (send email)
- **F2 (Save Draft)** → **`Ctrl+D`** (save draft)
- **F7 (Spell Check)** → **`Ctrl+Z`** (toggle spell check)
- **F8/F9 (Spell Nav)** → **`Ctrl+N`/`Ctrl+P`** (next/prev error)
- **F10 (Spell Config)** → **`Ctrl+,`** (configuration)

### Fixed Keyboard Conflicts
The original documentation had many conflicting shortcuts. We resolved these by:

1. **Message Actions**: Used modifier keys to avoid conflicts
   - `Ctrl+R` for reply (instead of conflicting `r`)
   - `Ctrl+F` for forward (instead of conflicting `f`)
   - `Shift+Delete` for delete message (instead of conflicting `d`)

2. **Message Navigation**: Reassigned folder shortcuts to avoid conflicts
   - `n`/`p` now navigate messages (previously conflicted with create folder)
   - `Ctrl+N` now creates folders (updated from `n`)

3. **Context-Aware Design**: Same base key can have different meanings in different contexts
   - `d` deletes folders when folder tree is focused
   - `Shift+Delete` deletes messages when message list is focused

### New Implementations
- ✅ Complete calendar management system
- ✅ Reply, Reply All, and Forward functionality
- ✅ Message navigation (next/previous)
- ✅ Message status changes (read/unread)
- ✅ Archive and delete operations
- ✅ Spell checking with comprehensive controls
- ✅ Universal terminal compatibility

## Tips for Current Version

### Learn the Working Shortcuts First
Start with the shortcuts marked with ✅ that are actually implemented:
1. Basic navigation (`j`, `k`, `Enter`)
2. Message actions (`Ctrl+R`, `Ctrl+F`, `n`, `p`)
3. Account management (`Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+X`)

### Context Awareness
Remember that shortcuts change meaning based on context:
- `d` deletes a folder when folder tree is focused
- `Shift+Delete` deletes messages when message list is focused
- `n`/`p` navigate between messages when message list is focused

### Status Bar
The status bar shows relevant shortcuts for your current context. When in doubt, check the bottom of the screen for available actions.

### Future Features
Many advanced features are planned but not yet implemented. This documentation will be updated as features are added in future releases.
