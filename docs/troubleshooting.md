# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you solve common issues that might arise while using Comunicado. Most problems have straightforward solutions, and this guide is organized by symptoms to help you find answers quickly.

## Connection and Synchronization Issues

### Cannot Connect to Email Server

**Symptoms**
- Error messages about connection failures
- Empty folder lists
- No new messages downloading
- Timeout errors during setup

**Common Causes and Solutions**

**Incorrect Server Settings**
1. Verify IMAP/SMTP server addresses
2. Check port numbers (typically 993 for IMAP, 587 for SMTP)
3. Ensure security settings match your provider (SSL/TLS vs STARTTLS)
4. Double-check username (often your full email address)

**Network Connectivity**
1. Test general internet connectivity
2. Check if your firewall blocks email ports
3. Try from a different network to isolate network-specific issues
4. Disable VPN temporarily to test connectivity

**Authentication Problems**
1. Verify password is correct
2. For Gmail: Use app-specific password instead of regular password
3. For OAuth2: Re-authenticate through the browser
4. Check if two-factor authentication requires special setup

**Corporate Network Restrictions**
1. Contact IT department about email port access
2. Check if proxy settings need configuration
3. Verify if corporate firewall allows direct IMAP/SMTP
4. Consider using webmail as a temporary workaround

### Synchronization Problems

**Messages Not Updating**
1. Check sync status in the status bar
2. Force refresh with `Ctrl+R`
3. Check if specific folders are excluded from sync
4. Verify server connection is stable

**Slow Synchronization**
1. Check network bandwidth and stability
2. Reduce number of messages synced initially
3. Sync folders individually rather than all at once
4. Consider peak usage times affecting server response

**Partial Message Download**
1. Check message size limits in settings
2. Verify sufficient local storage space
3. Test with smaller messages first
4. Check if attachments are being downloaded separately

## Interface and Display Issues

### Visual Display Problems

### Performance Issues

**Slow Response Times**
1. Check available system memory
2. Reduce number of cached messages
3. Close unnecessary applications
