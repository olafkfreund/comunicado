## Success Criteria

### Email Triage System
- [ ] Accurate priority scoring (>80% user agreement)
- [ ] Effective email categorization (>85% accuracy)
- [ ] Seamless UI integration with existing email list
- [ ] User-customizable triage rules and categories
- [ ] Performance impact <100ms per email
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Works with all existing AI providers
- [ ] Maintains privacy compliance
- [ ] Configurable through AI settings UI
- [ ] Backwards compatible with existing email workflow
- [ ] Proper error handling and fallbacks

## Architecture Considerations

### Triage Engine Design
```rust
pub struct EmailTriageService {
    ai_service: Arc<EnhancedAIService>,
    priority_scorer: Arc<PriorityScorer>,
    categorizer: Arc<EmailCategorizer>,
    vip_detector: Arc<VIPDetector>,
    config: Arc<RwLock<TriageConfig>>,
    stats: Arc<RwLock<TriageStats>>,
}
```

### Priority Scoring Factors
- **Sender Analysis** (30%): Relationship, frequency, importance
- **Content Analysis** (40%): Urgency keywords, deadlines, action items
- **Context Analysis** (20%): Thread importance, CC/BCC patterns
- **Historical Patterns** (10%): User interaction history

### Categorization Classes
- **Work**: Business emails, meetings, projects
- **Personal**: Family, friends, personal matters
- **Newsletters**: Subscriptions, updates, marketing
- **Promotions**: Sales, offers, advertisements
- **Social**: Social media notifications, community updates
- **Financial**: Banking, payments, receipts
- **Travel**: Bookings, confirmations, itineraries
- **Custom**: User-defined categories

## Dependencies

### Required Components
- Enhanced AI Service for content analysis
- Email database for historical data
- Configuration system for user preferences
- UI framework for triage display

### External Libraries
- Text processing for content analysis
- Machine learning for classification
- Statistics tracking for metrics
- Performance monitoring for optimization

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Impact**: Mitigate with background processing and caching
- **Accuracy Issues**: Implement user feedback learning and confidence thresholds
- **Privacy Concerns**: Ensure local processing options and transparent data handling

### User Experience Risks
- **Over-automation**: Provide user control and override capabilities
- **Category Confusion**: Clear category definitions and examples
- **False Positives**: Easy correction mechanisms and learning from mistakes

## Next Steps

1. **Decision Point**: Confirm email triage system as next priority
2. **Planning**: Create detailed implementation plan and timeline
3. **Setup**: Initialize development environment and dependencies
4. **Development**: Begin with core triage engine implementation
5. **Testing**: Continuous testing throughout development
6. **Integration**: UI integration and user experience testing
7. **Documentation**: User guides and technical documentation
