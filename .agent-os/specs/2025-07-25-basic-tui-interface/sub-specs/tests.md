## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**App State Management**
- Test initial application state creation with default values
- Test panel switching logic for all valid transitions
- Test application quit flag handling
- Test state validation for invalid panel transitions

**UI Layout Module**
- Test three-panel layout calculation with different terminal sizes
- Test panel size ratios remain consistent during resize
- Test minimum panel size constraints
- Test layout behavior with extremely small terminal sizes

**Event Handling**
- Test keyboard input mapping to application actions
- Test vim-style navigation key processing (h/j/k/l)
- Test tab key cycling through panels
- Test quit key ('q') setting appropriate state

### Integration Tests

**Application Lifecycle**
- Test application startup and initial state
- Test complete navigation cycle through all panels
- Test graceful application shutdown
- Test event loop processing with mock input events

**Terminal Rendering**
- Test UI rendering produces expected widget tree structure
- Test focus indicators appear on correct panels
- Test panel boundaries render correctly
- Test application handles terminal resize without crashing

**Keyboard Workflow**
- Test complete vim-style navigation workflow
- Test rapid key input doesn't cause state corruption
- Test invalid key inputs are handled gracefully
- Test focus state remains consistent during navigation

### Mocking Requirements

- **Terminal Backend:** Mock ratatui terminal backend for UI rendering tests
- **Event Stream:** Mock crossterm event stream for controlled input testing
- **Time-based Events:** Mock timer events for event loop testing
