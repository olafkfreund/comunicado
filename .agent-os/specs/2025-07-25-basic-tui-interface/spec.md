> Spec: Basic TUI Interface with Ratatui
> Created: 2025-07-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Establish the foundational TUI application structure using Ratatui that will serve as the base for all email client functionality, featuring a main application window with folder tree navigation and message list display optimized for keyboard-driven terminal workflows.

## User Stories

### Primary Email Navigation

As a terminal power user, I want to see a clean folder tree and message list interface when I launch Comunicado, so that I can efficiently navigate my email structure without needing external GUI applications.

The user launches the application and immediately sees a three-panel layout: a folder/account tree on the left, a message list in the center, and a preview/details panel on the right. Navigation between panels uses vim-style keybindings (h/j/k/l) with clear visual indicators showing the currently focused panel.

### Keyboard-Driven Workflow

As a developer who lives in the terminal, I want all interface interactions to be keyboard-driven with vim-like navigation, so that I can maintain my efficient terminal workflow without reaching for the mouse.

The interface responds to familiar keybindings: 'h' moves left, 'l' moves right, 'j/k' scroll within panels, 'q' quits, 'Tab' cycles between panels. Visual focus indicators clearly show which panel is active, and all interactions feel responsive and intuitive.

### Modern Terminal Aesthetics

As a user of contemporary terminal applications, I want the interface to feel modern and polished rather than outdated, so that the email client matches the quality of other tools in my development environment.

The interface uses modern terminal styling with clean borders, consistent spacing, appropriate colors that work in both light and dark terminal themes, and smooth visual transitions between states.

## Spec Scope

1. **Application Window Structure** - Create main three-panel layout with folder tree, message list, and preview areas
2. **Keyboard Navigation System** - Implement vim-style keybindings for panel focus and movement
3. **Visual Panel Management** - Provide clear focus indicators and panel boundaries using Ratatui widgets
4. **Basic Event Loop** - Establish terminal event handling for keyboard input and screen updates
5. **Terminal Compatibility** - Ensure proper rendering across modern terminals (Kitty, Foot, Wezterm)

## Out of Scope

- IMAP connection or email fetching functionality
- Email message parsing or display content
- Account configuration or authentication
- HTML rendering or rich content display
- Search functionality or email filtering
- Calendar integration or additional features

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional TUI Application** - A working Rust application that launches and displays the three-panel interface
2. **Keyboard Navigation** - Users can navigate between panels using vim-style keys and see clear focus indicators
3. **Responsive Interface** - The application handles terminal resize events and maintains proper layout proportions
