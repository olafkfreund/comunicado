> Spec: Startup Progress Bar System
> Created: 2025-07-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive startup progress bar system that provides visual feedback during Comunicado's initialization process, which currently takes 33+ seconds with multiple timeout-prone phases. The system will enhance user experience by showing clear progress indicators, phase descriptions, and graceful error handling during the potentially long startup sequence.

## User Stories

### Frustrated User Experience

As a terminal user starting Comunicado, I want to see clear visual feedback about the application's initialization progress, so that I understand the app is working properly and know what's happening during the long startup process.

**Current Problem:** Users experience a blank screen for up to 33 seconds during startup, with no indication that the application is loading or which services are being initialized. This creates uncertainty about whether the application has crashed or is still loading.

### Progress Transparency

As a power user, I want to see detailed information about which initialization phase is currently running and how long each phase typically takes, so that I can understand if something is taking unusually long and might need intervention.

**Detailed Workflow:** The progress bar displays the current phase (Database → IMAP → Account Setup → Services → Dashboard Services) with estimated completion times, timeout warnings, and the ability to continue even if some services fail to initialize.

### Error Recovery Understanding

As a user encountering startup issues, I want clear feedback when initialization phases fail or timeout, so that I can understand what functionality might be limited and whether I can still use the application.

**Error Handling:** When services timeout or fail, the progress bar shows clear error states while continuing with remaining initialization steps, providing users with transparency about what services are available.

## Spec Scope

1. **Startup Progress Display** - Full-screen progress bar with phase indicators and estimated completion times
2. **Phase Status Tracking** - Visual indicators for each initialization phase (pending, in-progress, completed, failed, timeout)
3. **Timeout Management** - Graceful handling of service timeouts with clear user feedback and continuation logic
4. **Error State Visualization** - Clear display of failed or timed-out services with impact descriptions
5. **Smooth Transitions** - Animated progress transitions and phase changes using Ratatui components
6. **Service Degradation Feedback** - Information about what functionality is available when services fail to initialize

## Out of Scope

- Reducing actual startup times (performance optimization is separate)
- Interactive startup configuration or service skipping
- Retry mechanisms for failed services during startup
- Background service initialization after main UI loads
- Startup progress persistence between application launches

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Visual Startup Experience** - Users see an informative progress bar instead of a blank screen during the 33+ second startup process
2. **Phase Transparency** - Clear indication of current initialization phase with descriptive messages and timeout countdown
3. **Graceful Error Handling** - Application continues startup even when services fail, with clear feedback about service availability
