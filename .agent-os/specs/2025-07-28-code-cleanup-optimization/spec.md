> Spec: Code Cleanup and Optimization Initiative
> Created: 2025-07-28
> Status: Completed

## Overview

Comprehensive technical debt elimination and code quality improvement initiative to fix content display issues, remove duplicate functionality, and establish maintainable code architecture.

## User Stories

### Email Content Display Quality

As a terminal email user, I want to see clean, properly formatted email content without raw HTML source code or technical headers, so that I can read emails efficiently without visual clutter.

**Detailed Workflow:** User opens HTML email and sees formatted text content similar to w3m/lynx browsers, with technical email headers (X-Mailer, Content-Transfer-Encoding, etc.) completely filtered out, leaving only essential information (From, To, Date, Subject).

### Developer Maintenance Experience

As a developer working on the codebase, I want clean, maintainable code without duplicate functions and dead code, so that I can develop new features efficiently without being hindered by technical debt.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developer reviews codebase and finds single-responsibility functions, minimal compiler warnings, and clear separation between database-layer and UI-layer processing.

## Spec Scope

1. **Duplicate Function Elimination** - Remove ~900 lines of duplicate content cleaning functions
2. **Dead Code Removal** - Eliminate 13+ unused functions across UI and backend modules
3. **Content Cleaning System** - Implement unified database-layer content processing with aggressive header filtering
4. **HTML Rendering Enhancement** - Establish w3m/lynx-style HTML display with security sanitization
5. **Compiler Warning Reduction** - Eliminate unused imports, variables, and dead code patterns

## Out of Scope

- Complete architectural rewrites of major modules
- Performance optimization beyond code cleanup
- New feature development during cleanup phase

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Clean Email Content Display** - Users see properly formatted emails without raw HTML or technical headers
2. **Reduced Codebase Complexity** - 900+ lines of duplicate/dead code removed
3. **Improved Code Quality** - 50%+ reduction in compiler warnings (81 to 37)
