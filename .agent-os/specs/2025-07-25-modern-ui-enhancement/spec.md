> Spec: Modern UI Enhancement with Integrated Calendar and Plugin System
> Created: 2025-07-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform Comunicado from a basic email client into a comprehensive communication and productivity hub by implementing a professional, minimalistic TUI interface, integrated CalDAV calendar system, and extensible plugin architecture. This expansion includes advanced email organization features (threading, customizable interface elements, comprehensive sorting), full calendar functionality with meeting management, and a robust plugin system enabling integration with external productivity tools and services.

## User Stories

### Professional Interface Redesign

As a terminal power user, I want a clean and professional interface without childish icons or distracting elements, so that I can maintain focus during long email sessions and present a professional appearance when using the client in workplace environments.

The interface should embrace minimalism with subtle borders, consistent spacing, clean typography, and muted color schemes. Icons should be replaced with text labels or simple ASCII symbols. The overall aesthetic should feel contemporary and serious, matching the expectation of professional terminal applications like modern editors and system monitors.

### Customizable Interface Components

As a user with specific workflow needs, I want to customize which interface elements are visible and how they're arranged, so that I can optimize my screen real estate and focus on the most important information for my use case.

Users should be able to toggle visibility of sidebar panels, customize the information shown in email lists (sender, subject, date, size, flags), adjust column widths, and save different layout presets. This includes the ability to hide/show folder trees, preview panes, status bars, and other UI components based on terminal size and user preference.

### Email Threading and Conversation View

As someone who manages complex email discussions, I want related emails grouped into conversation threads with clear visual hierarchy, so that I can follow email discussions more efficiently and avoid missing context from earlier messages.

The system should group emails by subject line (with Re:, Fwd: variations), Message-ID references, and In-Reply-To headers. Threaded conversations should display with indentation levels, collapse/expand functionality, and clear indicators showing thread depth and response count. Navigation should allow jumping between threads and individual messages seamlessly.

### Advanced Sorting and Filtering

As a user managing high-volume email, I want comprehensive sorting options by date, sender, receiver, subject, size, and custom criteria, so that I can quickly locate specific emails and organize my workflow based on different priorities.

Sorting should be instantaneous with support for ascending/descending order, multi-column sorting (primary and secondary sort keys), and persistent sort preferences per folder. Additional sorting criteria should include read/unread status, flagged status, attachment presence, and email priority levels.

### Intuitive Navigation Enhancement

As a vim user who values keyboard efficiency, I want enhanced navigation that maintains vim-style keybindings while adding more intuitive shortcuts and visual feedback, so that I can work faster while still being accessible to users less familiar with vim conventions.

Navigation improvements should include clear visual indicators for current selection, breadcrumb navigation showing current location, contextual help showing available actions, and smooth scrolling with visual feedback. Key bindings should be discoverable with on-screen hints and consistent across different interface modes.

### Integrated Calendar System

As a terminal user managing both email and calendar tasks, I want a fully integrated CalDAV calendar system within the TUI interface, so that I can manage appointments, meetings, and schedules without leaving my terminal environment or switching to separate applications.

The calendar system should provide multiple view modes (day, week, month), event creation and editing capabilities, CalDAV synchronization with popular providers (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.), and seamless integration with email meeting invitations. Users should be able to view their schedule alongside their email, respond to meeting requests directly from emails, and create events from email content. The calendar should support recurring events, reminders, and multi-calendar management from different sources.

### Plugin System Architecture

As a productivity-focused user who relies on various terminal tools, I want an extensible plugin system that allows integration with external services and applications like taskwarrior, chat applications, and other productivity tools, so that I can create a unified workflow hub tailored to my specific needs.

The plugin system should provide a clean API for third-party developers to create integrations, support for both internal and external plugins, plugin discovery and management capabilities, and sandbox security for community plugins. Common integrations should include task management systems, note-taking applications, chat services, and development tools. The plugin architecture should maintain the core TUI design principles while allowing rich functionality extensions.

### AI-Powered Assistant Integration

As a busy professional managing high-volume email and complex scheduling, I want AI assistance to help me summarize emails, compose responses, manage tasks, schedule meetings, and organize my daily workflow, so that I can process information more efficiently and focus on high-priority activities.

The AI system should integrate with multiple providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Ollama for local AI) and provide intelligent email summarization, response drafting, task extraction from emails, meeting scheduling assistance, and spam detection. Additional AI features should include voice control for hands-free operation, real-time spell checking and formatting suggestions, and an intelligent start panel that provides daily summaries and prioritized action items. The AI should learn from user preferences and adapt its suggestions accordingly.

### RSS and Content Aggregation

As a professional who needs to stay updated on industry news and trends, I want integrated RSS feed support including YouTube and other video platforms, so that I can consume relevant content alongside my email and calendar without switching applications.

The RSS system should support traditional RSS/Atom feeds, YouTube channel subscriptions, podcast feeds, and other content platforms. Content should be organized by categories, support offline reading, and provide AI-powered content summarization and relevance scoring. The interface should allow quick scanning of headlines with expandable content views and integration with email workflow for sharing and archiving important articles.

### Multi-Account Visual Identity and Status System

As a user managing multiple email accounts and different contexts (work, personal, clients), I want clear visual indicators showing which profile I'm currently using and comprehensive status information, so that I can quickly understand my context and avoid sending emails from the wrong account.

Each email profile should have a distinctive color-coded footer that clearly identifies the active account, along with a professional powerline-style status bar similar to Neovim that displays email count, calendar events, task status, sync indicators, and system information. The status bar should be highly informative yet clean, providing real-time feedback about all system components while maintaining the professional aesthetic established throughout the interface.
