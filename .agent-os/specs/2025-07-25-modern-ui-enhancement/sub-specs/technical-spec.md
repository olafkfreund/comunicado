# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-25-modern-ui-enhancement/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-25
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Professional Theme System**: Implement new theme with muted colors, subtle borders, and consistent spacing using ratatui's styling system
- **UI Component Architecture**: Create modular UI components that can be toggled on/off and repositioned dynamically
- **Threading Engine**: Develop email threading logic using Message-ID, In-Reply-To, and References headers with SQLite storage for thread relationships
- **Sorting Framework**: Build flexible sorting system supporting multiple criteria with persistent storage in user configuration
- **Enhanced Input Handling**: Extend keyboard navigation with visual feedback and contextual help system
- **CalDAV Calendar System**: Implement full CalDAV client with RFC 4791 compliance, event management, calendar synchronization, and iCalendar format support
- **Calendar UI Components**: Design calendar-specific TUI components including day/week/month views, event forms, and meeting invitation handlers
- **Email-Calendar Integration**: Create seamless workflow between email and calendar for meeting invitations, scheduling, and event creation from emails
- **Plugin Architecture Framework**: Build extensible plugin system with trait-based API, dynamic loading, sandbox security, and inter-plugin communication
- **Plugin Management System**: Develop plugin discovery, installation, configuration, and lifecycle management with dependency resolution
- **AI Integration System**: Implement multi-provider AI client supporting OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Ollama with unified API abstraction and context management
- **Voice Control Interface**: Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities with wake word detection and natural language command processing
- **AI Content Processing**: Create intelligent email analysis, summarization, response generation, and spam detection with user preference learning
- **RSS Aggregation Engine**: Build comprehensive RSS/Atom feed parser with YouTube API integration and multi-platform content support
- **Intelligent Start Panel**: Design AI-generated dashboard with personalized daily summaries, priority recommendations, and actionable insights
- **Multi-Account Visual System**: Create color-coded profile identification with distinctive footers and context-aware visual indicators
- **Powerline Status Bar**: Implement comprehensive status bar with real-time system information, styled like professional terminal status bars (Neovim/tmux)

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Incremental Enhancement of Existing UI
- Pros: Lower risk, maintains existing functionality, gradual rollout possible
- Cons: May carry forward design debt, limited architectural improvements

**Option B:** Complete Architecture Redesign with Modular Plugin System (Selected)
- Pros: Clean architecture, proper separation of concerns, extensible plugin foundation, easier to extend and maintain
- Cons: Significantly higher development effort, potential for breaking changes, complex integration testing

**Rationale:** The expansion to include calendar functionality and plugin system requires fundamental architectural changes. A complete redesign allows implementing proper component architecture, plugin isolation, and cross-system integration from the start. The modular approach enables independent development of email, calendar, and plugin components.

## External Dependencies

- **ratatui**: Already in use, no version change needed
- **crossterm**: Already in use for input handling
- **serde**: For configuration serialization (already in project)
- **sqlx**: For enhanced database queries supporting threading (upgrade from basic SQLite usage)
- **chrono**: For calendar date/time handling and timezone support
- **ical**: For iCalendar format parsing and generation (RFC 5545 compliance)
- **reqwest**: For CalDAV HTTP operations and calendar synchronization
- **wasmtime**: For plugin sandboxing and WebAssembly plugin execution
- **libloading**: For dynamic loading of native plugins (optional alongside WASM)
- **uuid**: For generating unique identifiers for events and plugin instances
- **async-trait**: For plugin trait definitions with async methods
- **tokio-openai**: For OpenAI API integration and chat completions
- **google-ai-generativelanguage1**: For Google Gemini API integration
- **ollama-rs**: For local Ollama model integration
- **whisper-rs**: For speech-to-text voice control functionality
- **tts**: For text-to-speech output capabilities
- **feedparser**: For RSS/Atom feed parsing and content extraction
- **youtube_dl**: For YouTube feed processing and video metadata
- **regex**: For intelligent content parsing and pattern matching
- **unicode-segmentation**: For proper text processing and AI content analysis

**Justification:** AI integration requires API clients for multiple providers plus local processing capabilities. Voice control needs speech recognition and synthesis libraries. RSS aggregation requires specialized feed parsing and content extraction. All dependencies are mature, well-maintained crates that align with the async architecture and performance requirements.
