> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive AI assistant functionality within Comunicado to provide intelligent email management, content summarization, calendar scheduling assistance, and productivity automation while maintaining privacy-first design and local processing options.

## User Stories

### Intelligent Email Assistant

As a terminal power user, I want AI-powered email assistance to help me compose professional replies, summarize long email threads, and automatically categorize incoming messages, so that I can process my inbox more efficiently without leaving my terminal environment.

The AI assistant will analyze email context, suggest appropriate responses, extract key information from lengthy messages, and provide intelligent filtering based on content analysis. Users can choose between local AI processing (Ollama) for privacy or cloud-based services for enhanced capabilities.

### Smart Calendar Scheduling

As a busy professional, I want AI assistance in scheduling meetings and managing calendar conflicts, so that I can optimize my time and coordinate with others more effectively.

The AI will parse natural language scheduling requests, suggest optimal meeting times based on calendar availability, handle meeting invitation responses intelligently, and provide context-aware scheduling recommendations that consider time zones, meeting preferences, and availability patterns.

### Content Processing and Summarization

As a privacy-conscious developer, I want AI-powered content summarization and analysis that respects my privacy preferences, so that I can quickly process large volumes of email and calendar information without compromising sensitive data.

The system will offer local AI processing options through Ollama for complete privacy, while also supporting cloud-based AI services with explicit user consent and data handling transparency.
