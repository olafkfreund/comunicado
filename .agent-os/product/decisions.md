## 2025-07-25: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Launch Comunicado as a modern TUI-based email and calendar client for terminal power users, privacy-conscious developers, and system administrators. The product will provide native HTML email rendering, integrated CalDAV calendar functionality, and multi-provider OAuth2 support while maintaining zero external dependencies for core features.

### Context

The terminal email client market is dominated by legacy solutions like mutt and alpine that lack modern features. Users are forced to choose between feature-rich GUI clients that break terminal workflows or outdated TUI clients that can't handle modern email content. Additionally, Linux lacks a standardized calendar solution that integrates well with terminal-based workflows.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Fork existing mutt/neomutt**
   - Pros: Established user base, proven architecture
   - Cons: Legacy codebase limitations, poor HTML support, external dependency requirements

2. **Build GUI application with terminal themes**
   - Pros: Easier media rendering, standard UI patterns
   - Cons: Breaks terminal workflow, defeats core value proposition

3. **Focus only on email without calendar**
   - Pros: Simpler scope, faster time to market
   - Cons: Misses opportunity for integrated workflow, fragmented user experience

### Rationale

Modern terminals (Kitty, Foot, Wezterm) now support advanced graphics protocols that enable rich content rendering. Rust provides excellent async capabilities for email protocols and strong TUI frameworks. The combination of email and calendar addresses a real workflow need for terminal users while creating a unique market position.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- First modern TUI email client with full HTML and media support
- Integrated calendar solution fills gap in Linux desktop ecosystem
- Rust implementation provides memory safety and performance
- CalDAV standards enable interoperability with other applications

**Negative:**
- Significant development complexity for custom IMAP/CalDAV implementations
- Limited initial terminal compatibility (though improving rapidly)
- Small initial target market compared to GUI alternatives

## 2025-07-25: Technical Architecture Decisions

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Rust with Ratatui for the TUI framework, implement custom IMAP/CalDAV clients rather than using external tools, and support CalDAV standards for calendar sharing with other Linux applications.

### Context

Need to choose core technologies that can deliver modern email and calendar functionality while maintaining terminal-native experience and avoiding external dependencies.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Use existing IMAP tools (mbsync, offlineimap)**
   - Pros: Battle-tested, existing user familiarity
   - Cons: External dependencies, configuration complexity, integration challenges

2. **Different language choices (Go, C++, Python)**
   - Pros: Various ecosystem advantages
   - Cons: Rust provides best combination of performance, safety, and async support

3. **Proprietary calendar format**
   - Pros: Easier implementation, full control
   - Cons: Poor interoperability, vendor lock-in concerns

### Rationale

Rust's async capabilities and memory safety are ideal for network-heavy email/calendar protocols. Ratatui provides modern TUI development with good terminal compatibility. Custom protocol implementations eliminate external dependencies while CalDAV standards ensure interoperability.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero external dependencies for core functionality
- Modern async architecture for better performance
- Standards-based calendar sharing enables ecosystem integration
- Rust safety guarantees reduce security vulnerabilities

**Negative:**
- Higher initial development effort for protocol implementations
- Smaller developer ecosystem compared to more established languages
- Need to maintain protocol compatibility ourselves

## 2025-07-25: User Experience Philosophy

**ID:** DEC-003  
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Lead

### Decision

Prioritize keyboard-driven workflows with vim-style keybindings while providing modern visual design that doesn't feel like legacy terminal applications.

### Context

Target users are primarily terminal power users who expect efficient keyboard navigation, but they also deserve modern, polished interfaces that match contemporary terminal application standards.

### Rationale

Keyboard efficiency is essential for terminal users' productivity, while modern visual design helps adoption and reduces the "outdated" perception of TUI applications.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Familiar navigation for target users
- Efficient workflow with minimal mouse dependency
- Contemporary appearance increases appeal
- Consistent with modern terminal application trends

**Negative:**
- Steeper learning curve for non-terminal users
- Additional complexity in UI design and implementation
